Spider Solitaire (One Suit)
Spider Solitaire is a popular card game with the objective to remove all cards from the field. This version uses only one suit, making it simpler and more accessible for beginners. Below are the rules and gameplay instructions for this variant.

Game Rules
Objective: The main goal is to remove all cards from the field.
Removing Cards: Cards are removed by creating descending sequences of the same suit from King to Ace.
Stacking Cards: You can place a card on another card of one rank higher regardless of the suit. For example, a 7 can be placed on an 8, and so on.
Moving Sequences: Any descending sequence of cards of the same suit can be moved together as a unit.
Empty Slots: You can place any card in an empty slot.
Dealing New Cards: Clicking on the deck will deal an additional row of cards to the field.
Restrictions on Dealing: A new row of cards cannot be dealt if there is at least one empty slot on the field.
How to Play
Setup: At the start of the game, cards are dealt into 10 columns. The first 4 columns have 6 cards each, and the remaining columns have 5 cards each. The top card of each column is face-up.
Gameplay:
Look for available moves where you can stack cards to create descending sequences.
Move complete sequences of the same suit from King to Ace to remove them from the field.
Use empty slots strategically to rearrange cards and create more moves.
Deal new rows of cards from the deck when you run out of moves. Remember, you canâ€™t deal a new row if there is an empty slot on the field.
